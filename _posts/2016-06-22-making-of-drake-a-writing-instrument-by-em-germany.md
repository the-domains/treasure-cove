**How it started ...**

Back in 1899 e+m Holzprodukte was founded by Mr Konrad Ehmann.   
Under his brandname Turnery Ehmann he produced more than 10.000 different models of nib penholders for customers all over the world and became Germany´s largest manufacturer of nib penholders. During the World War 2 the production was completely destroyed and only few models could further be produced.   
Following the needs after the war, mainly technical wood turnings were produced.

**... and how it followed up.**

In 1983 Mr. Wolfram Mümmler, the fourth generation of the founder family, restarted the production of wooden writing instruments.

A variety of clutch pencils, wooden pens, mechanical pencils and accessories were developed and are now one of the major product lines.  
Since 2003 Mr. Wolfram Mümmler is the sole owner of the business and established the company name e+m Holzprodukte.  
The "e" stands for the founder Ehmann and the "m" stands for Mümmler, the   
CEO and owner.

One of his major concerns is to keep the old traditions of classical manufacturing alive and to transform them into the modern production process.

More than 100 years after the foundation, e+m Holzprodukte are again one of the leading manufacturers of wooden writing instruments.
